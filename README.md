# TODOMVC

In this repository, I will propose two implementations of [TODOMVC](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/) for [React](https://github.com/facebook/react).
One will be designed with an imperative paradigm (using classes) and the other one with the functional paradigm (hooks and functional components).
The goal is to ease the understanding of the differences between using React with classes or with hooks and functional components.

In addition, I will propose a REST API to enable the design of new versions of TODOMVC that use a backend.
In my opinion, it could be a nice addition to TODOMVC in order to help developers learn how to use a REST API within a MVC frontend.
I consider this as an interesting point as the design of frontends using a REST API became an industry standard.

I also plan on proposing a [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) implementation for those who would like to discover how to design frontends on top of GraphQL APIs.

## Project Structure

You can find the two React implementations in [frontend](/frontend) and the REST API and GraphQL implementation in [backend](/backend).

If you're not familiar with this, the frontend and backend terms refers to the architecture used. These terms have been explained [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/frontend-vs-backend/).
